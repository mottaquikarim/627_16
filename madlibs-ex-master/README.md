# Madlibs (Simple)

This problem requires that you read user input from the 4 input fields (**when** the user clicks the submission button), process the inputs through a madlibs generation function (provided), and output the madlib to the browser for the user to see. 

A small bit of the problem is already completed for you, your job is to finish off the job. Note that the output must go into the `js-madlibs-output` HTML element.
